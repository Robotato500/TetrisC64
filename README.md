# TetrisC64
Project files for C64Studio of a greek-themed Tetris clone for the C64.

I've made this repository public for my MIT portfolio, so you'll have to excuse me if the code is a bit disorganised and not well commented, but it was a private thing only I was supposed to read. If you just found this page browsing through GitHub well, I hope you find this project interesting!

First of all, I invite you to download the Commodore 64 disk image file “tetris.d64” inside the “release” folder and run it on an emulator to look at this little game by yourself, if you have the time. Use the A and D keys to rotate the pieces, S to make them go down and Return to begin the game.

I’m glad to say that I designed and wrote the code all by myself, except for a 10 line routine to divide numbers I didn’t feel like writing. I’ve looked at no examples or inspiration sources at all, only reading the C64’s original programmer’s manual and forum posts on how the video chip is interfaced with and how to implement music. My main reference for 6502 assembly was a book I physically own by Lance Leventhal. I also designed the graphics by myself using the tools included in C64Studio, except for the bust at the start screen, which I copied pixel by pixel from a pixel-art drawing I found online. I got the music from a C64 music format file I found in a repository.

I've thought about publishing this program, but first I would have to clean and properly comment the code, polish some aspects and look at how to address the licensing of the music and the bust picture. Maybe if I find some time I’ll try to do these procedures, but I don’t think it’s any likely, as I basically wrote this game for my own pleasure.
